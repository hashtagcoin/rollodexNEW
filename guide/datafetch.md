Troubleshooting Continuous Data Fetching in React Native (Supabase)
When a React Native screen (e.g. an Explore screen with a FlatList) keeps fetching data from Supabase every time you enter it, it's usually due to effect dependencies or navigation behavior. Follow this step-by-step guide to identify the cause and fix repeated fetches:
Step 1: Check the useEffect Dependency Array (Avoid Infinite Loops)
Improper useEffect usage is a common culprit for continuous or repeated fetching. Investigate your effect’s dependency array and state updates:
Missing Dependency Array: If you call the fetch function in a useEffect without a dependency array, it runs on every render. This can cause an infinite loop if the effect updates state, because updating state triggers a re-render, which calls the effect again
geeksforgeeks.org
. Solution: Add an empty array ([]) to run the fetch only on the first mount (one-time), or list specific variables that should trigger a re-fetch. This ensures the effect isn’t called on every render.
Including State in Dependencies and Updating It: If your effect depends on a state value that it also updates (for example, fetching data then storing it in state), you can create a loop. Every state update re-triggers the effect because the dependency changed. For instance, a useEffect that lists data in its dependencies but also calls setData inside will keep firing continuously

. Solution: Remove the state from the dependency array if the effect’s purpose is to load that state. Use an empty array for a one-time fetch, or use a conditional inside the effect to only fetch when needed (e.g. if data is empty).
Unstable References in Dependencies: Functions or objects defined inside your component are new on every render, so if you include them in the dependency array, the effect will run each time. React compares dependencies by reference; an object or lambda function will fail the comparison on every render

. Solution: Only include stable values in dependencies. Use useCallback or useMemo for functions/objects that need to be stable across renders, or remove them from the dependency array if appropriate.
Troubleshooting Tip: If you suspect an infinite loop, add a console.log inside the effect to see if it fires repeatedly. Ensure that setting state inside the effect isn’t immediately causing the effect to run again. By carefully managing the dependency array, you can prevent unnecessary or infinite re-fetching

Step 2: Understand Navigation Triggers (Focus and Remounting)
Next, consider how navigating to the Explore screen triggers the effect. React Navigation’s behavior can cause re-fetching in these scenarios:
Component Remount on Screen Entry: In some navigation configurations, navigating away and back will unmount and remount the screen. For example, if using a Bottom Tab Navigator with unmountOnBlur: true, the screen’s component is destroyed whenever you leave it, and re-created when you return
stackoverflow.com
. In this case, a useEffect with an empty dependency ([]) will run every time the screen mounts (i.e. on each entry). This explains data fetching “every time the screen is entered.” Solution: Decide if you really need to unmount the screen on blur. If not, remove unmountOnBlur (the screen will stay mounted, preserving state and only fetching once). If unmounting is desired, implement caching (see Step 4) so that repeated mounts use cached data instead of hitting the network every time.
Screen Remains Mounted (Stack Navigator): By default, React Navigation (Stack) doesn’t unmount a screen when you navigate to a new one; it stays in memory. In such cases, a useEffect with empty dependencies runs only on the first render and will not run again just by returning to the screen
stackoverflow.com
. If you observe repeated fetches on a Stack screen, it’s likely not due to automatic remounting, but rather an explicit focus handling (see next point).
Focus Events Triggering Fetch: It’s common to refresh data when a screen gains focus. You might be using navigation.addListener('focus', ...) or React Navigation’s hooks like useFocusEffect or useIsFocused. These will intentionally call your effect every time the screen is focused (such as when the user navigates back to it)
reactnavigation.org
. For example, you may have something like:
jsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {
    fetchData();  // fetch Supabase data on every focus
  });
  return unsubscribe;
}, [navigation]);
This pattern causes a re-fetch each time you enter or return to the screen, by design. Similarly, using useFocusEffect or watching useIsFocused() in an effect achieves the same result (calling the fetch on focus)
reactnavigation.org
stackoverflow.com
.
Solution: If continuous refresh is not desired, remove or modify the focus listener. You might only want to fetch on the first mount, or only when certain conditions are met (e.g. data was updated elsewhere). If you do need to refresh on focus, consider adding a condition or a stale timer (see Step 3 and 4) so it doesn’t always hit the network if not necessary.
Navigation Params Changes: Less commonly, if your effect depends on route parameters or props that change when navigating to the screen, it could re-run. Check the dependency array for route.params or similar. If a param is updated on navigation, the effect will trigger again. Ensure you include only the relevant params or remove them if not needed to trigger a fetch every time.
By understanding how navigation affects mounting and focusing, you can pinpoint why the effect runs repeatedly. In summary: if the screen is remounting, the effect will naturally run each time (fix by preventing unmount or caching data). If the screen is mounted but still refetching, a focus-based trigger is likely in place (fix by adjusting that trigger).
Step 3: Prevent Repeated Fetches on Re-Entry
Once you identify what’s causing the repeated fetch, apply best practices to prevent unnecessary network calls when re-entering the screen:
Use Conditional Fetching: Implement logic to fetch only when needed. For example, if you want fresh data only on first load, skip fetching on subsequent focuses. You could track a “hasFetched” state or useRef. For instance:
jsx
Copy
Edit
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [hasFetched, setHasFetched] = useState(false);

useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    if (!hasFetched) {
      fetchData().then(() => setHasFetched(true));
    }
  }, [hasFetched])
);
This will fetch data the first time the screen is focused, but not on later focuses (until the component unmounts). If the component unmounts on blur, hasFetched will reset, so consider a broader cache for persistence (next bullet).
Cache Data Across Navigations: To avoid refetching the same 4 items every time, store them in a higher scope. For example, use a Context or a state management solution (Redux, Zustand, etc.) to hold the data. When the Explore screen mounts, check if cached data exists: if yes, use it instead of fetching; if no, fetch and then store it globally. This way, returning to the screen uses the in-memory cache. A Stack Overflow suggestion outlines two approaches: (1) implement your own cache with a global store (Context/Redux), or (2) use a data fetching library that caches for you
stackoverflow.com
.
Avoid Redundant Focus Fetches: If you used navigation listeners for refresh, consider whether you truly need to refetch on every focus. Perhaps only refetch when coming back from a screen that potentially changed the data (you can pass a param or use a global flag to indicate data was modified). React Navigation allows sending parameters back or using events to signal a refresh only in specific cases. By tailoring when you refresh, you reduce unnecessary calls.
Manual Refresh Control: Instead of always auto-fetching on screen entry, you can fetch once and then allow users to pull-to-refresh (using FlatList’s refreshControl) or tap a refresh button when they want updated data. This gives control to the user and avoids constant background re-fetching.
Ensure Proper Cleanup: Though not directly about repeated fetches, remember to clean up any subscriptions or pending requests on unmount. If you use useFocusEffect or an event listener, it should unsubscribe on cleanup to prevent memory leaks or duplicate listeners accumulating
reactnavigation.org
. This won’t stop the first call, but it prevents weird behavior if the component mounts/unmounts multiple times.
By implementing the above, you make sure that simply navigating back-and-forth doesn’t always trigger network calls. The idea is to fetch only when necessary and reuse data when possible, especially since the data set is small (just 4 items).
Step 4: Optimize Data Fetching & Caching (Supabase-Specific Tips)
To further improve efficiency, consider how you fetch and cache data from Supabase:
Understand Supabase Caching: The Supabase JS client does not cache data by default – every .select() request hits the network/database
stackoverflow.com
. That means if you call the same query repeatedly, it will not automatically use any local cache. Knowing this, it’s important to implement caching on the client side if you want to avoid repeated fetches. For example, after the first fetch, store the result in state or a cache so subsequent renders can use it without waiting for the network.
Leverage React Query or SWR: A recommended approach is to use a library like React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR for data fetching. These libraries provide built-in caching, deduping of requests, and stale data management. With React Query, you could do something like:
jsx
Copy
Edit
// Inside your component (ensure a QueryClientProvider is set up at app level)
const { data: exploreItems, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
  ['exploreItems'],              // unique key for this query
  async () => {
    let { data, error } = await supabase.from('explore').select('*');
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },
  { staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 }   // e.g. 5 minutes cache duration
);
The first time, this will fetch from Supabase. On subsequent screen entries, React Query will return cached data immediately and only refetch in the background if the data is stale or if you explicitly invalidate it. This drastically cuts down unnecessary calls
makerkit.dev
. React Query also makes it easy to “re-fetch” on certain events (like screen focus) if you enable that behavior, but you can configure it. Overall, it abstracts away manual useEffect handling and prevents multiple fetches of the same data by caching results in memory
dhiwise.com
.
Implement Data Caching Manually: If adding a library is not an option, you can manually cache data. For example, keep a module-level variable or use AsyncStorage to persist the fetched list. However, be cautious with manual caching – ensure you update or invalidate it when data changes. A context state that lives beyond the screen’s lifecycle is often the simplest approach for manual caching in React Native.
Use Supabase Subscriptions for Real-Time (Optional): Since you mentioned not using live subscriptions, this is optional. But for completeness: Supabase can push real-time updates via channels (if using Postgres changes). If your 4 items change frequently and you want the latest data without manual refresh, subscribing to the table can update your state when data changes, avoiding the need to fetch on each screen focus. This is more complex to set up and not needed if data changes are infrequent, but it’s an option for live data updates without continuous polling.
Optimize Query Efficiency: Ensure your Supabase query itself is efficient. Fetch only the fields you need (select('field1, field2') instead of select('*') if you don’t need all columns). With only 4 items this isn’t a big issue, but it’s good practice. Also, if those 4 items are static or rarely change, you might even hardcode them or fetch once at app start to reduce calls.
Beware of Development vs Production Behavior: Note that in React 18+, Strict Mode in development will intentionally mount and unmount components twice on initial render to help catch bugs. This can cause a useEffect to run twice on mount in dev (which might appear like a double fetch)
dhiwise.com
dhiwise.com
. In production, this doesn’t happen. Just keep this in mind while debugging – if you see a double-fetch on first load in dev, it could be Strict Mode doing a double invoke. The solutions above (proper dependencies and caching) will mitigate any serious issues from this, and you generally shouldn't disable Strict Mode except for debugging purposes

Step 5: Verify the Fix and Best Practices Recap
After applying changes, test the behavior:
Initial Load: The Explore screen should fetch data once on first entry. Confirm the data loads properly into the FlatList.
Re-Entering Screen: Navigate away (to another screen) and back. Now check if a network request is made again or not, depending on your intended behavior. If you implemented caching, it should not refetch (or might fetch in background without blocking the UI). If you kept a focus refresh intentionally, it will refetch – ensure this is what you want.
State Persistence: If you used a global store or React Query, verify that the data persists between screen navigations. The FlatList can show cached data immediately. Add a manual refresh action if the user needs to force update.
No Infinite Loops: Ensure the useEffect isn’t firing continuously (check logs or network calls) when the screen is sitting open. If you still see constant fetching while on the screen, re-check your dependency array for an overlooked state or prop causing re-renders.
Cleanup: Make sure to remove any console logs or unnecessary listeners. If using focus listeners or subscriptions, verify they are cleaned up on screen unmount (they should be if set up as shown above). This prevents potential memory leaks or duplicate fetch calls.
By following these steps, you eliminate redundant data fetching and improve your app’s performance. The key takeaways are: use useEffect correctly (with proper dependencies), understand how navigation focus/unmounting affects your component, and implement a caching strategy for your Supabase data. With these fixes, your Explore screen will load data efficiently without continuously hitting the database on every visit.
