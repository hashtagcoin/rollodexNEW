### Calendar-Based Availability System Implementation

#### Problem Statement

* **Issue**: The current service provider availability system uses a simple toggle without the ability to manage specific dates and time slots
* **Goal**: Implement a calendar-based availability system that allows providers to block out unavailable days and timeslots
* **Integration**: Data should be saved to the existing Supabase `provider_availability` table and respected during the booking process

#### Progress Made

* **Database Analysis**: 

  * Verified the existing `provider_availability` table schema (id, provider_id, service_id, date, time_slot, available, created_at, updated_at)
  * Confirmed the `service_bookings` table structure for integration

* **Component Design Planning**:
  * Designed a modern visual calendar interface following Airbnb-style UI patterns
  * Created a task list for implementing the full availability management system
  * Planned the integration between the provider settings and booking flow

#### Next Steps

* **Files to Create**:
  * `src/components/calendar/AvailabilityCalendarModal.js` - Main calendar modal component
  * `src/components/calendar/TimeSlotSelector.js` - Grid-based time slot selection component
  * `src/components/calendar/AvailabilityLegend.js` - Visual indicators for availability status
  * `src/hooks/useAvailability.js` - Custom hook for managing availability data

* **Files to Modify**:
  * `src/screens/Provider/CreateServiceListingScreen.js` - Add "Manage Availability" button
  * `src/screens/Main/BookingsScreen.js` - Update to filter by available time slots
  * `src/screens/Provider/ProviderCalendarScreen.js` - Enhance with new calendar components

* **Database Operations**:
  * Create a view to join `provider_availability` with `service_bookings`
  * Implement batch operations for setting recurring availability patterns

* **Integration Points**:
  * Provider Management: Allow providers to set available time slots per service
  * Booking System: Only show truly available slots to participants
  * Real-time Updates: Handle conflicts when multiple users try to book the same slot

### Provider Dashboard Implementation

#### Database Schema Migration

* **Implementation**: Created and executed database migrations for the provider dashboard functionality
  * Added `provider_availability` table to manage service provider time slots
  * Added `service_agreement_templates` table for providers to store document templates
  * Created a `bookings_with_provider_details` view to efficiently retrieve booking information
  * Added dashboard preferences to the `service_providers` table
  * Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data protection

  **Key Files/Components Modified**:
  - Migration scripts executed via Supabase

#### Provider Dashboard Screens

* **Implementation**: Created a comprehensive suite of provider dashboard screens with consistent UI/UX
  * Implemented Airbnb-style cards for listings and Instagram-style horizontal lists for appointments
  * Created uniform header and bottom navigation components
  * Built responsive forms with proper validation and error handling

  **Key Files Created**:
  - `src/screens/Provider/AppointmentDetailScreen.js` - View and manage appointment details

#### User Flow and Screen Connections

* **Main Provider Workflow**:
  1. User toggles to Provider Mode in the ProfileScreen or DashboardScreen
  2. ProviderDashboardScreen shows key metrics (bookings, revenue) and upcoming appointments
  3. From the dashboard, providers can navigate to:
     - ManageListingsScreen → Create/Edit Service/Housing listings
     - ProviderAppointmentsScreen → AppointmentDetailScreen
     - ServiceAgreementsScreen → CreateServiceAgreement/ServiceAgreementDetail
     - ProviderCalendarScreen for availability management

* **Listings Management Flow**:
  1. ManageListingsScreen displays all service and housing listings
  2. Create new listings via CreateServiceListingScreen or CreateHousingListingScreen
  3. Edit existing listings via EditServiceListingScreen or EditHousingListingScreen
  4. All listing screens handle image uploads, form validation, and database operations

* **Appointment Management Flow**:
  1. View all appointments in ProviderAppointmentsScreen
  2. AppointmentDetailScreen allows viewing client details and updating appointment status
  3. Actions include confirming, completing, or canceling appointments

* **Agreement Management Flow**:
  1. ServiceAgreementsScreen manages both templates and agreements
  2. CreateServiceAgreementScreen can use templates or custom content
  3. ServiceAgreementDetailScreen handles viewing, signing, and updating agreement status

### Social Feed Screen Enhancements

#### Issue: Inconsistent Button Layout and Styling

*   **Problem**: The social feed screen had inconsistent button styling and layout, with some buttons appearing cropped and uneven spacing between elements. The header section had a gray background that didn't match the app's design language.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Restyled the sticky header to use a clean, white background
    *   Centered the navigation buttons (Groups, Housing, Events)
    *   Added a "Saved" button with a bookmark icon
    *   Improved button spacing and padding for better visual balance
    *   Removed unnecessary shadows and backgrounds for a cleaner look

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/SocialFeedScreen.js`
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

#### Issue: Image Loading Errors

*   **Problem**: When images failed to load, the UI would show broken image icons and error messages, creating a poor user experience.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Created a reusable `FallbackImage` component that gracefully handles image loading errors
    *   Implemented a placeholder image that displays when the main image fails to load
    *   Added error handling to prevent UI crashes from failed image loads

    **Key Files Created/Modified**:
    - `src/components/common/FallbackImage.js` (New)
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

    **Code Example**:
    ```javascript
    // FallbackImage component usage
    <FallbackImage
      source={{ uri: imageUrl }}
      style={styles.image}
      fallbackSource={require('../../assets/images/placeholder.png')}
      onError={handleImageError}
    />
    ```

#### Issue: User Avatars Not Displaying

*   **Problem**: User avatars in posts were not displaying correctly, showing either broken images or placeholders even when valid avatar URLs were available.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Updated the avatar URL handling to properly format and validate image URLs
    *   Implemented the `FallbackImage` component for avatar images
    *   Added proper error handling for avatar image loading

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

### Group Detail Screen Updates

#### Issue: Inconsistent UI for Group Actions

*   **Problem**: The group detail screen had inconsistent UI elements for group actions (Join/Leave, Favorite) and lacked visual feedback for user actions.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Replaced the star icon with a heart icon for favoriting groups
    *   Added visual feedback (color change) when a group is favorited
    *   Implemented dynamic Join/Leave button that updates based on the user's membership status
    *   Improved the overall layout and spacing of action buttons

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/GroupDetailScreen.js`

#### Issue: Navigation and Layout Inconsistencies

*   **Problem**: The group detail screen had inconsistent navigation patterns and layout issues, particularly on different screen sizes.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Standardized the navigation pattern to match the rest of the app
    *   Implemented proper header with back button and title
    *   Ensured consistent padding and margins across all screen sizes
    *   Added proper scrolling behavior for content that exceeds screen height

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/GroupDetailScreen.js`
    - `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`

### Git Repository Management

#### Issue: Submodule Updates Not Reflecting in Main Repository

*   **Problem**: Changes made in the RollodexApp submodule were not being properly reflected in the main repository, causing synchronization issues.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Committed and pushed changes to the RollodexApp submodule first
    *   Updated the main repository to track the latest submodule changes
    *   Used `git add RollodexApp` to stage the submodule changes
    *   Committed and pushed the main repository with the updated submodule reference

    **Commands Used**:
    ```bash
    # In RollodexApp directory
    git add .
    git commit -m "Enhance social feed and group detail screens with improved UI/UX and error handling"
    git push

    # In main repository directory
    git add RollodexApp
    git commit -m "Update RollodexApp submodule with latest changes"
    git push -u origin master --force
    ```

### Fix: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning in DashboardScreen

*   **Problem**: A warning `Warning: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.` was appearing in the console. The call stack indicated the issue originated from a `TouchableOpacity` component within the `DashboardScreen`. 

*   **Solution**:
    *   Wrapped the children of `TouchableOpacity` components in an additional `View` container to ensure proper JSX structure.
    *   This isolated the content within a single, well-structured child element for the `TouchableOpacity`.

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/DashboardScreen.js`

    **Code Example**:
    ```javascript
    // Before
    <TouchableOpacity>
      <IconComponent />
      <Text>Button Text</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>

    // After
    <TouchableOpacity>
      <View>
        <IconComponent />
        <Text>Button Text</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableOpacity>
    ```
    This change resolved the warning.


***CHAT***

Let me summarize the updates we've made to fully implement the Instagram-style chat modal integration:

ChatDetail Component Updates:
Fully integrated with the useChat hook for message fetching, sending, and real-time subscriptions
Added proper error handling with Instagram-style error states and retry options
Enhanced empty state UI with Instagram-style icons and messaging
Improved participant rendering to work directly with conversation data
Added automatic scrolling to the latest message
MessageBubble Component Improvements:
Updated to use the standardized BUBBLE_COLORS from chatConstants
Enhanced styling for read receipts and timestamps to match Instagram design
Maintained consistent avatar and name display for participants
NewConversation Integration:
Now uses the createConversation function from the useChat hook
Added proper loading and error states with consistent messaging
Streamlined the conversation creation process
All components now work together seamlessly with the useChat hook providing centralized data management and real-time updates. The UI follows Instagram-style design patterns with consistent colors, fonts, and interaction patterns.

The chat system is now fully integrated with proper error handling, loading states, and empty states throughout. Users will experience a smooth, Instagram-style chat experience consistent with the rest of the app.

Is there any specific part of the chat feature you'd like me to explain in more detail or any additional enhancements you'd like to make?

***UseAvatar***

Here is a list of files in your codebase that contain <Image tags, which are likely candidates for user avatar images and should be reviewed for replacement with the new UserAvatar component:

Files with <Image tags (likely avatar usages):
src/screens/Groups/CreateHousingGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Provider/CreateHousingListingScreen.js
src/screens/Main/BookingConfirmationScreen.js
src/screens/Social/CollectionDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Provider/AppointmentDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Main/BookingDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Groups/CreateSocialGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Social/PostDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Groups/EditGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Social/PostDetailScreenNew.js
src/screens/Details/HousingDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Details/HousingGroupDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Bookings/CreateBookingScreen.js
src/screens/Details/ServiceDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Main/DashboardScreen.js
src/screens/Auth/SignInScreen.js
src/screens/Auth/SplashScreen.js
src/components/LoadingScreen.js

src/screens/Main/EventDetailScreen.js
src/components/bookings/BookingConfirmationModal.js
src/components/cards/EventCard.js
src/components/social/PostCard.js
src/screens/Main/ProfileScreen.js
src/screens/Main/UserProfileScreen.js
src/components/chat/ChatModal.js
src/components/social/FriendsList.js
src/components/social/FriendCard.js
src/components/social/ChatListItem.js
src/components/social/GroupMemberItem.js
src/components/social/StoryAvatar.js
Note: Some <Image> usages are for non-avatar images (e.g., post images, group images, backgrounds, etc.). I will carefully review each file and only replace those that are user avatars.

Next Step
I will begin with the most critical and user-facing screens/components, such as:

ProfileScreen.js
UserProfileScreen.js
PostCard.js
FriendsList.js
FriendCard.js
ChatListItem.js
GroupMemberItem.js
StoryAvatar.js
After each update, I will let you test before proceeding to the next batch.

Would you like me to start with the main profile/friends/post/chat components first? If so, I’ll update those files and let you know when to test.
