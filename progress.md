### Calendar-Based Availability System Implementation

#### Problem Statement

* **Issue**: The current service provider availability system uses a simple toggle without the ability to manage specific dates and time slots
* **Goal**: Implement a calendar-based availability system that allows providers to block out unavailable days and timeslots
* **Integration**: Data should be saved to the existing Supabase `provider_availability` table and respected during the booking process

#### Progress Made

* **Database Analysis**: 

  * Verified the existing `provider_availability` table schema (id, provider_id, service_id, date, time_slot, available, created_at, updated_at)
  * Confirmed the `service_bookings` table structure for integration

* **Component Design Planning**:
  * Designed a modern visual calendar interface following Airbnb-style UI patterns
  * Created a task list for implementing the full availability management system
  * Planned the integration between the provider settings and booking flow

#### Next Steps

* **Files to Create**:
  * `src/components/calendar/AvailabilityCalendarModal.js` - Main calendar modal component
  * `src/components/calendar/TimeSlotSelector.js` - Grid-based time slot selection component
  * `src/components/calendar/AvailabilityLegend.js` - Visual indicators for availability status
  * `src/hooks/useAvailability.js` - Custom hook for managing availability data

* **Files to Modify**:
  * `src/screens/Provider/CreateServiceListingScreen.js` - Add "Manage Availability" button
  * `src/screens/Main/BookingsScreen.js` - Update to filter by available time slots
  * `src/screens/Provider/ProviderCalendarScreen.js` - Enhance with new calendar components

* **Database Operations**:
  * Create a view to join `provider_availability` with `service_bookings`
  * Implement batch operations for setting recurring availability patterns

* **Integration Points**:
  * Provider Management: Allow providers to set available time slots per service
  * Booking System: Only show truly available slots to participants
  * Real-time Updates: Handle conflicts when multiple users try to book the same slot

### Provider Dashboard Implementation

#### Database Schema Migration

* **Implementation**: Created and executed database migrations for the provider dashboard functionality
  * Added `provider_availability` table to manage service provider time slots
  * Added `service_agreement_templates` table for providers to store document templates
  * Created a `bookings_with_provider_details` view to efficiently retrieve booking information
  * Added dashboard preferences to the `service_providers` table
  * Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data protection

  **Key Files/Components Modified**:
  - Migration scripts executed via Supabase

#### Provider Dashboard Screens

* **Implementation**: Created a comprehensive suite of provider dashboard screens with consistent UI/UX
  * Implemented Airbnb-style cards for listings and Instagram-style horizontal lists for appointments

  3. From the dashboard, providers can navigate to:
     - ManageListingsScreen → Create/Edit Service/Housing listings
     - ProviderAppointmentsScreen → AppointmentDetailScreen
     - ServiceAgreementsScreen → CreateServiceAgreement/ServiceAgreementDetail
     - ProviderCalendarScreen for availability management

* **Listings Management Flow**:
  1. ManageListingsScreen displays all service and housing listings
  2. Create new listings via CreateServiceListingScreen or CreateHousingListingScreen
  3. Edit existing listings via EditServiceListingScreen or EditHousingListingScreen
  4. All listing screens handle image uploads, form validation, and database operations

* **Appointment Management Flow**:
  1. View all appointments in ProviderAppointmentsScreen
  2. AppointmentDetailScreen allows viewing client details and updating appointment status
  3. Actions include confirming, completing, or canceling appointments

* **Agreement Management Flow**:
  1. ServiceAgreementsScreen manages both templates and agreements
  2. CreateServiceAgreementScreen can use templates or custom content
  3. ServiceAgreementDetailScreen handles viewing, signing, and updating agreement status

### Social Feed Screen Enhancements

#### Issue: Inconsistent Button Layout and Styling

*   **Problem**: The social feed screen had inconsistent button styling and layout, with some buttons appearing cropped and uneven spacing between elements. The header section had a gray background that didn't match the app's design language.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Restyled the sticky header to use a clean, white background
    *   Centered the navigation buttons (Groups, Housing, Events)
    *   Added a "Saved" button with a bookmark icon
    *   Improved button spacing and padding for better visual balance
    *   Removed unnecessary shadows and backgrounds for a cleaner look

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/SocialFeedScreen.js`
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

#### Issue: Image Loading Errors

*   **Problem**: When images failed to load, the UI would show broken image icons and error messages, creating a poor user experience.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Created a reusable `FallbackImage` component that gracefully handles image loading errors
    *   Implemented a placeholder image that displays when the main image fails to load
    *   Added error handling to prevent UI crashes from failed image loads

    **Key Files Created/Modified**:
    - `src/components/common/FallbackImage.js` (New)
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

    **Code Example**:
    ```javascript
    // FallbackImage component usage
    <FallbackImage
      source={{ uri: imageUrl }}
      style={styles.image}
      fallbackSource={require('../../assets/images/placeholder.png')}
      onError={handleImageError}
    />
    ```

#### Issue: User Avatars Not Displaying

*   **Problem**: User avatars in posts were not displaying correctly, showing either broken images or placeholders even when valid avatar URLs were available.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Updated the avatar URL handling to properly format and validate image URLs
    *   Implemented the `FallbackImage` component for avatar images
    *   Added proper error handling for avatar image loading

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/social/PostCardFixed.js`

### Group Detail Screen Updates

#### Issue: Inconsistent UI for Group Actions

*   **Problem**: The group detail screen had inconsistent UI elements for group actions (Join/Leave, Favorite) and lacked visual feedback for user actions.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Replaced the star icon with a heart icon for favoriting groups
    *   Added visual feedback (color change) when a group is favorited
    *   Implemented dynamic Join/Leave button that updates based on the user's membership status
    *   Improved the overall layout and spacing of action buttons

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/GroupDetailScreen.js`

#### Issue: Navigation and Layout Inconsistencies

*   **Problem**: The group detail screen had inconsistent navigation patterns and layout issues, particularly on different screen sizes.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Standardized the navigation pattern to match the rest of the app
    *   Implemented proper header with back button and title
    *   Ensured consistent padding and margins across all screen sizes
    *   Added proper scrolling behavior for content that exceeds screen height

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/GroupDetailScreen.js`
    - `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`

### Git Repository Management

#### Issue: Submodule Updates Not Reflecting in Main Repository

*   **Problem**: Changes made in the RollodexApp submodule were not being properly reflected in the main repository, causing synchronization issues.

*   **Solution**:
    *   Committed and pushed changes to the RollodexApp submodule first
    *   Updated the main repository to track the latest submodule changes
    *   Used `git add RollodexApp` to stage the submodule changes
    *   Committed and pushed the main repository with the updated submodule reference

    **Commands Used**:
    ```bash
    # In RollodexApp directory
    git add .
    git commit -m "Enhance social feed and group detail screens with improved UI/UX and error handling"
    git push

    # In main repository directory
    git add RollodexApp
    git commit -m "Update RollodexApp submodule with latest changes"
    git push -u origin master --force
    ```

### Fix: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning in DashboardScreen

*   **Problem**: A warning `Warning: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.` was appearing in the console. The call stack indicated the issue originated from a `TouchableOpacity` component within the `DashboardScreen`. 

*   **Solution**:
    *   Wrapped the children of `TouchableOpacity` components in an additional `View` container to ensure proper JSX structure.
    *   This isolated the content within a single, well-structured child element for the `TouchableOpacity`.

    **Key Files Modified**:
    - `src/screens/Main/DashboardScreen.js`

    **Code Example**:
    ```javascript
    // Before
    <TouchableOpacity>
      <IconComponent />
      <Text>Button Text</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>

    // After
    <TouchableOpacity>
      <View>
        <IconComponent />
        <Text>Button Text</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableOpacity>
    ```
    This change resolved the warning.


***CHAT***

Let me summarize the updates we've made to fully implement the Instagram-style chat modal integration:

ChatDetail Component Updates:
Fully integrated with the useChat hook for message fetching, sending, and real-time subscriptions
Added proper error handling with Instagram-style error states and retry options
Enhanced empty state UI with Instagram-style icons and messaging
Improved participant rendering to work directly with conversation data
Added automatic scrolling to the latest message
MessageBubble Component Improvements:
Updated to use the standardized BUBBLE_COLORS from chatConstants
Enhanced styling for read receipts and timestamps to match Instagram design
Maintained consistent avatar and name display for participants
NewConversation Integration:
Now uses the createConversation function from the useChat hook
Added proper loading and error states with consistent messaging
Streamlined the conversation creation process
All components now work together seamlessly with the useChat hook providing centralized data management and real-time updates. The UI follows Instagram-style design patterns with consistent colors, fonts, and interaction patterns.

The chat system is now fully integrated with proper error handling, loading states, and empty states throughout. Users will experience a smooth, Instagram-style chat experience consistent with the rest of the app.

Is there any specific part of the chat feature you'd like me to explain in more detail or any additional enhancements you'd like to make?

***UseAvatar***

Here is a list of files in your codebase that contain <Image tags, which are likely candidates for user avatar images and should be reviewed for replacement with the new UserAvatar component:

Files with <Image tags (likely avatar usages):
src/screens/Groups/CreateHousingGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Provider/CreateHousingListingScreen.js
src/screens/Main/BookingConfirmationScreen.js
src/screens/Social/CollectionDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Provider/AppointmentDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Main/BookingDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Groups/CreateSocialGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Social/PostDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Groups/EditGroupScreen.js
src/screens/Social/PostDetailScreenNew.js
src/screens/Details/HousingDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Details/HousingGroupDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Bookings/CreateBookingScreen.js
src/screens/Details/ServiceDetailScreen.js
src/screens/Main/DashboardScreen.js
src/screens/Auth/SignInScreen.js
src/screens/Auth/SplashScreen.js
src/components/LoadingScreen.js
src/components/layout/AppHeader.js
src/screens/Provider/EditHousingListingScreen.js
src/components/HousingGroup/ApplicationItem.js
src/components/ModernImagePicker.js
src/screens/Main/EventDetailScreen.js
src/components/bookings/BookingConfirmationModal.js
src/components/cards/EventCard.js
src/components/social/PostCard.js
src/screens/Main/ProfileScreen.js
src/screens/Main/UserProfileScreen.js
src/components/chat/ChatModal.js
src/components/social/FriendsList.js
src/components/social/FriendCard.js
src/components/social/ChatListItem.js
src/components/social/GroupMemberItem.js
src/components/social/StoryAvatar.js
Note: Some <Image> usages are for non-avatar images (e.g., post images, group images, backgrounds, etc.). I will carefully review each file and only replace those that are user avatars.

Next Step
I will begin with the most critical and user-facing screens/components, such as:

ProfileScreen.js
UserProfileScreen.js
PostCard.js
FriendsList.js
FriendCard.js
ChatListItem.js
GroupMemberItem.js
StoryAvatar.js
After each update, I will let you test before proceeding to the next batch.

Would you like me to start with the main profile/friends/post/chat components first? If so, I’ll update those files and let you know when to test.

## 2025-01-17: ProviderDiscoveryScreen Performance Optimization

### Problem Statement
The ProviderDiscoveryScreen experienced significant lag when switching between categories (Therapy, Housing, Support, etc.). Users reported visible delays in image and card loading, making the UI feel sluggish despite implementing CachedImage components and data caching.

### Diagnostic Approach
1. **Added comprehensive timing logs** to track:
   - Component mount/unmount cycles with unique IDs
   - Render counts and timing
   - Category change events
   - Data fetch start/complete times
   - Cache hit/miss events
   - Focus/blur screen events

2. **Key diagnostic code pattern**:
```javascript
// Performance tracking
const performanceTracker = {
  componentId: `PDS-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
  mountTime: null,
  renders: 0,
  categoryChanges: {},
  fetchTimes: {},
  imageTimes: {}
};

const debugTiming = (action, details = {}) => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const elapsed = performanceTracker.mountTime ? timestamp - performanceTracker.mountTime : 0;
  console.log(`[PROVIDER-TIMING][${performanceTracker.componentId}][${elapsed}ms] ${action}`, {
    timestamp,
    elapsed,
    ...details
  });
};
```

### Root Causes Discovered
1. **Multiple Redundant Fetches**: Each category change triggered 3+ fetch calls:
   - Initial fetch from category change effect
   - Focus event fetch
   - Additional duplicate fetches
   
2. **Cache Not Working**: The cache was never populated after fetches, forcing fresh data loads every time

3. **Wrong Import**: ProviderDiscoveryContainer was importing `ProviderDiscoveryScreen.old` instead of the current version

4. **Focus Event Issues**: Screen refetched data on every focus event, even when data was already cached

5. **No Fetch Deduplication**: Multiple simultaneous fetches for the same category weren't prevented

### Solution Implementation

#### 1. Prevent Duplicate Fetches
```javascript
// Add fetch tracking refs
const fetchInProgressRef = useRef(false);
const lastFetchCategoryRef = useRef(null);

// In fetchData function
const fetchData = useCallback(async (isRefreshing = false, targetPage = 0, append = false) => {
  // Prevent duplicate fetches
  if (fetchInProgressRef.current && lastFetchCategoryRef.current === selectedCategory && !append) {
    debugTiming('FETCH_PREVENTED_DUPLICATE', { 
      category: selectedCategory,
      isRefreshing,
      targetPage
    });
    return;
  }
  
  fetchInProgressRef.current = true;
  lastFetchCategoryRef.current = selectedCategory;
  
  try {
    // ... fetch logic
  } finally {
    fetchInProgressRef.current = false;
  }
}, [selectedCategory, searchTerm]);
```

#### 2. Fix Cache Population
```javascript
// After successful fetch
if (append) {
  setItems(prev => [...prev, ...filteredData]);
} else {
  setItems(filteredData);
  // Update cache when not appending
  cacheRef.current[selectedCategory] = filteredData;
}

// For favorites
setUserFavorites(prev => {
  const newSet = append ? new Set([...prev, ...favoritedIds]) : favoritedIds;
  // Update favorites cache when not appending
  if (!append) {
    favoritesCacheRef.current[selectedCategory] = newSet;
  }
  return newSet;
});
```

#### 3. Smart Category Change Handling
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Show cached data instantly
  if (cacheRef.current[selectedCategory]) {
    setItems(cacheRef.current[selectedCategory]);
    const cachedFavs = favoritesCacheRef.current[selectedCategory];
    setUserFavorites(cachedFavs ? new Set(cachedFavs) : new Set());
    setLoading(false);

    // Only fetch if not already fetching this category
    if (!fetchInProgressRef.current || lastFetchCategoryRef.current !== selectedCategory) {
      fetchData(false, 0, false);
    }
  } else {
    // No cache – fetch immediately
    if (!fetchInProgressRef.current || lastFetchCategoryRef.current !== selectedCategory) {
      fetchData(false, 0, false);
    }
  }
}, [selectedCategory]);
```

#### 4. Conditional Focus Refresh
```javascript
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    // Only fetch if we don't have cached data for current category
    if (!cacheRef.current[selectedCategory]) {
      fetchData(false, 0, false);
    }
    
    return () => {
      console.log('[ProviderDiscovery] Screen unfocused');
    };
  }, [selectedCategory])
);
```

### Reusable Pattern for Other Screens

To apply this optimization pattern to other screens with similar category/tab switching:

1. **Add fetch tracking refs**:
```javascript
const fetchInProgressRef = useRef(false);
const lastFetchCategoryRef = useRef(null);
const cacheRef = useRef({});
const favoritesCacheRef = useRef({});
```

2. **Implement fetch deduplication** at the start of your fetch function

3. **Populate cache** after successful fetches (non-append operations)

4. **Use cached data immediately** when switching categories/tabs

5. **Only fetch on focus** if cache is empty

6. **Add timing logs** during development to identify bottlenecks

### Results
- Reduced fetch calls from 3+ per category change to 1
- Instant category switching when data is cached
- Eliminated redundant fetches on focus events
- Smoother UI with proper loading states
- Better user experience with perceived instant loading

### Key Takeaways
1. Always check for and prevent duplicate in-flight requests
2. Implement proper caching at the component level for instant UI updates
3. Use diagnostic logging to identify performance bottlenecks
4. Focus events should be smart about when to refresh data
5. Test with wrong imports (e.g., `.old` files) that might cause issues
