### Fix: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning in DashboardScreen

*   **Problem**: A warning `Warning: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.` was appearing in the console. The call stack indicated the issue originated from a `TouchableOpacity` component within the `DashboardScreen`. This warning typically occurs when a string literal (including whitespace or newlines) is rendered directly inside a component like `View` or `TouchableOpacity` without being wrapped in a `<Text>` component.

*   **Solution**:
    *   The `TouchableOpacity` components used for the "Reorder last service" and "Your Matches" buttons in `src/screens/Main/DashboardScreen.js` were reviewed.
    *   Although the direct text content was already within `<Text>` tags, such warnings can sometimes be caused by subtle JSX formatting or how sibling elements are interpreted.
    *   To ensure robust rendering and eliminate potential stray text nodes, the children of each `TouchableOpacity` (the icon and the `<Text>` components) were wrapped in an additional `<View>` container. This isolates the content within a single, well-structured child element for the `TouchableOpacity`.

    ```javascript
    // Before (Conceptual)
    // <TouchableOpacity>
    //   <IconComponent />
    //   <Text>Button Text</Text>
    // </TouchableOpacity>

    // After (Applied Fix)
    // <TouchableOpacity>
    //   <View>
    //     <IconComponent />
    //     <Text>Button Text</Text>
    //   </View>
    // </TouchableOpacity>
    ```
    This change resolved the warning.
