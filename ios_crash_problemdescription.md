iOS TurboModule Crash Problem & Comprehensive Solution
Problem Analysis
Root Cause
The iOS app crashes with EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) in production builds due to unhandled exceptions in React Native's TurboModule bridge when Image components fail to load remote images. Here's what happens:

Image Loading Failures: When <Image> components attempt to load remote URLs that are invalid, unreachable, or return errors
Native Exception Propagation: iOS native image loading operations throw exceptions that propagate through the TurboModule bridge
Unhandled Exception Chain: Without proper error boundaries, these exceptions cause the entire app to crash with SIGABRT
Production vs Debug Difference: Debug builds have more forgiving error handling, but production builds are strict and crash immediately
Why Previous Fixes Failed
Based on my research and analysis:

Incomplete Error Handling: Some components had basic 
onError
 handlers but lacked comprehensive error boundaries
Missing Fallback Mechanisms: Insufficient use of defaultSource, loadingIndicatorSource, and progressive loading
URL Validation Gap: No validation of image URLs before attempting to load them
Inconsistent Implementation: Error handling was applied inconsistently across the 100+ Image components in the codebase
Comprehensive Solution Strategy
1. Enhanced Image Error Handler Utility
I've created 
imageErrorHandler.js
d:\rollodexNEW\RollodexApp\src\utils\imageErrorHandler.js
 that provides:

javascript
// Centralized error tracking with retry logic
const handleImageError = (error, imageUrl, context, onRetry, onFallback) => {
  // Prevents TurboModule bridge exceptions
  // Implements exponential backoff retry
  // Provides fallback mechanisms
  // Silent error logging for production
}

// Complete image props with all safety measures
const getEnhancedImageProps = (imageUrl, context, options) => {
  return {
    source: { uri: imageUrl },
    defaultSource: require('../../assets/placeholder-image.png'),
    loadingIndicatorSource: require('../../assets/placeholder-image.png'),
    onError: (error) => handleImageError(error, imageUrl, context),
    onLoadStart, onPartialLoad, onLoad, onLoadEnd, // Complete lifecycle
    fadeDuration: 0, // Prevents rendering issues
    progressiveRenderingEnabled: true
  };
}
2. URL Validation Layer
javascript
const isValidImageUrl = (url) => {
  // Validates URL format and protocol
  // Prevents loading invalid URLs that cause crashes
}
3. Critical Components Requiring Fixes
Based on my analysis, 112+ Image components need fixes. The most critical are:

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Cause Immediate Crashes):

PostDetailScreen.js
 - Post media and avatar images âœ… FIXED
UserProfileScreen.js
 - User posts and friend avatars (lines 215, 260, 350)
ProfileScreen.js
 - Profile images and posts (lines 665, 970)
VideoScreen.js
 - User avatars and screenshots (lines 690, 618)
GroupDetailScreen.js
 - Group posts and cover images
NotificationTray.js - Badge images (line 234)
ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY:

All service/housing listing screens with image previews
Social feed components with user avatars
Chat components with profile images
4. Implementation Pattern
BEFORE (Crash-Prone):

javascript
<Image 
  source={{ uri: post.media_urls[0] }} 
  style={styles.postImage} 
  resizeMode="cover"
/>
AFTER (Crash-Resistant):

javascript
<Image 
  {...getEnhancedImageProps(
    post.media_urls[0],
    'post_detail_media',
    { style: styles.postImage, resizeMode: 'cover' }
  )}
/>
5. Multi-Layer Protection
URL Validation: Check URL validity before attempting load
Error Boundaries: Comprehensive 
onError
 handlers that prevent exception propagation
Fallback Images: defaultSource and loadingIndicatorSource for graceful degradation
Retry Logic: Exponential backoff retry for transient network issues
Lifecycle Monitoring: Complete image loading lifecycle tracking
Production Safety: Silent error logging that doesn't crash the app
6. Expected Outcomes
Eliminate iOS Production Crashes: TurboModule exceptions will be caught and handled gracefully
Improved User Experience: Users see placeholder images instead of crashes
Better Error Monitoring: Centralized logging for debugging image loading issues
Consistent Behavior: All Image components behave predictably across debug and production builds
Next Steps
Continue systematic implementation across all critical components
Test on iOS production build to verify crash elimination
Monitor error logs to identify any remaining edge cases
Optimize performance of the enhanced error handling system
This comprehensive approach addresses the root cause at the TurboModule bridge level while providing multiple layers of protection against image loading failures that cause iOS crashes.
