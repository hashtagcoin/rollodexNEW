For an Expo SDK 53 React Native app using React 19 and Supabase, the best image picker that allows users to crop images is expo-image-picker combined with react-native-image-crop-picker. While expo-image-picker is the go-to choice for Expo due to its seamless integration and support for image selection, it has limited cropping capabilities. To enable advanced cropping (e.g., custom aspect ratios, freeform cropping), react-native-image-crop-picker is the preferred solution, as it works well with Expo via custom dev clients and offers robust cropping features.
Below, I’ll outline why this combination is ideal, how to set it up, and how it integrates with your tech stack (Expo SDK 53, React 19, Supabase).
Why expo-image-picker + react-native-image-crop-picker?
expo-image-picker:
Native Expo module, compatible with Expo SDK 53 and React 19.

Simple API for selecting images from the gallery or camera.

Built-in allowsEditing option provides basic cropping (platform-native UI, e.g., iOS’s default cropper).

Limitations: Basic cropping with fixed aspect ratios; no advanced customization.

react-native-image-crop-picker:
Offers advanced cropping features: custom aspect ratios, freeform cropping, rotation, and compression.

Supports both iOS and Android with a consistent UI.

Works with Expo via a custom dev client, ensuring compatibility with Expo SDK 53.

Actively maintained and widely used in the React Native community.

Supabase Integration: Both libraries provide image data (URI, base64, or file objects) that can be uploaded to Supabase Storage, as shown in your previous question.

React 19 Compatibility: No known issues with React 19, as both libraries focus on native modules and minimal React dependencies.

Setup and Implementation
1. Install Dependencies
Install expo-image-picker for basic selection (if you want fallback or simpler use cases):
bash

npx expo install expo-image-picker

Install react-native-image-crop-picker:
bash

npm install react-native-image-crop-picker

Since react-native-image-crop-picker is not a managed Expo module, you need a custom dev client for Expo SDK 53:
bash

npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android # or npx expo run:ios

This builds a custom development app with native module support.

2. Request Permissions
Both libraries require permissions for accessing the gallery or camera.
javascript

import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
import ImageCropPicker from 'react-native-image-crop-picker';

const requestPermissions = async () => {
  const { status } = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();
  if (status !== 'granted') {
    alert('Permission to access photos is required!');
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};

3. Implement Image Picker with Cropping
Create a function to handle image selection and cropping using react-native-image-crop-picker. This example also includes a fallback to expo-image-picker for basic use cases.
javascript

import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
import { decode } from 'base64-arraybuffer';
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient'; // From your previous setup

const pickAndCropImage = async () => {
  try {
    const hasPermission = await requestPermissions();
    if (!hasPermission) return null;

    // Use react-native-image-crop-picker for advanced cropping
    const result = await ImageCropPicker.openPicker({
      cropping: true,
      width: 800, // Desired width
      height: 800, // Desired height
      cropperCircleOverlay: false, // Set to true for circular crop
      compressImageQuality: 0.8, // 0 to 1 (1 = no compression)
      includeBase64: true, // For Supabase upload
      mediaType: 'photo',
    });

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error picking image:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

// Fallback to expo-image-picker (optional)
const pickImageBasic = async () => {
  try {
    const hasPermission = await requestPermissions();
    if (!hasPermission) return null;

    const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
      allowsEditing: true, // Basic cropping
      aspect: [1, 1], // Fixed aspect ratio (optional)
      quality: 0.8,
    });

    if (result.canceled) return null;
    return result.assets[0];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error picking image:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

4. Upload Cropped Image to Supabase
Adapt the upload function from your previous question to handle the cropped image:
javascript

const uploadImage = async (image, bucketName = 'documents', userId) => {
  try {
    const uri = image.path || image.uri; // react-native-image-crop-picker uses `path`
    const fileExt = uri.split('.').pop();
    const fileName = `${userId}/${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`;
    const contentType = `image/${fileExt === 'jpg' ? 'jpeg' : fileExt}`;

    // Read file as Base64
    const base64 = image.base64 || (await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(uri, {
      encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
    }));

    // Convert Base64 to ArrayBuffer
    const arrayBuffer = decode(base64);

    // Upload to Supabase
    const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
      .from(bucketName)
      .upload(fileName, arrayBuffer, {
        contentType,
        upsert: true,
      });

    if (error) {
      console.error('Upload error:', error);
      throw error;
    }

    // Get public URL
    const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
      .from(bucketName)
      .getPublicUrl(fileName);

    return { path: fileName, publicUrl: urlData.publicUrl };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading image:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

5. Integrate into Your Component
Combine the picker and upload logic in a React component:
javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, Image, Alert } from 'react-native';

const ImageUploadScreen = () => {
  const [imageUri, setImageUri] = useState(null);
  const userId = 'user123'; // Replace with actual user ID from auth

  const handlePickAndUpload = async () => {
    const image = await pickAndCropImage();
    if (!image) return;

    setImageUri(image.path || image.uri);
    try {
      const { publicUrl } = await uploadImage(image, 'documents', userId);
      Alert.alert('Success', `Image uploaded: ${publicUrl}`);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to upload image');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      {imageUri && <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />}
      <Button title="Pick and Crop Image" onPress={handlePickAndUpload} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default ImageUploadScreen;

Key Features of react-native-image-crop-picker
Customizable Cropping: Set width, height, and cropperCircleOverlay for precise control.

Compression: Adjust compressImageQuality to balance quality and file size.

Base64 Support: Use includeBase64 for direct compatibility with Supabase uploads.

Camera Support: Optionally use ImageCropPicker.openCamera for capturing and cropping photos.

Compatibility with Your Tech Stack
Expo SDK 53: Requires a custom dev client for react-native-image-crop-picker. Follow Expo’s guide for setting up a dev client.

React 19: No known issues, as the library interacts with native modules, not React’s rendering layer.

Supabase: The output (URI or base64) integrates seamlessly with the Supabase Storage upload process described earlier.

iOS/Android: Both platforms are fully supported, with consistent cropping UI.
